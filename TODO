- integrate with ImageJ's tool bar (rotate tool, reuse zoom and pan)
- overlay objects (reuse the 3D window)
- organize as 3 plugins (sharing a core): slice, surface and volume 
  rendering
- have a tool to iterate through slices when left/right clicking (or 
  scroll-wheeling) on a slice
- have a way to open a list of objects, being able to reassign to a new 3D 
  window, or open another view of the same objects (e.g. a second slice, 
  or an isosurface)
- make it scriptable (for movie generation, presentations)
- scissors tool (remove volume by selecting in 2D, interpreting as 3D)
- segmentation tool (as scissors, but works only on isosurfaces, i.e. 
  thresholded objects, and does not remove, but rather label it)
- add listener interfaces (looking at, entering, 3D coordinate, etc.)
