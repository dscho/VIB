- integrate with ImageJ's tool bar (rotate tool, reuse zoom and pan)
- overlay objects (reuse the 3D window)
- organize as 3 plugins (sharing a core): slice, surface and volume 
  rendering
- have a tool to iterate through slices when left/right clicking (or 
  scroll-wheeling) on a slice
- have a way to open a list of objects, being able to reassign to a new 3D 
  window, or open another view of the same objects (e.g. a second slice, 
  or an isosurface)
- make it scriptable (for movie generation, presentations)
- scissors tool (remove volume by selecting in 2D, interpreting as 3D)
- segmentation tool (as scissors, but works only on isosurfaces, i.e. 
  thresholded objects, and does not remove, but rather label it)
- add listener interfaces (looking at, entering, 3D coordinate, etc.)

segmentation editor: CustomStackWindow -> SegmentationEditorPanel

VIB:
	- make Image3DCanvas be able to display two isosurfaces
	- eye candy: file list with processes already done (checkboxes)
	- VIB_Leica_Reader: fix negative voxelDepth (and revert all the other
	  voodoo to work around that)
	- Gaussian Blur before optimising
	- get rid of Amira Tables
	- separate "AmiraTable_Writer" out of "AmiraMeshWriter_".
	- general code cleanup (DO_CHANGES...)
	- fix names (like AmiraMesh_Writer instead of AmiraMeshWriter_)
	- ImageMetaData.upToDate(): look at template, too
	- fix Segmenation Editor to open the labels upon "OK" if outside VIB
