<h1>Release History:</h1>
<pre>
  
  2008/03/07 (v4.0c):
   - minor bugfixes
   - fixed the binding to HyperVolumeBrowser
   - added support for linescan (scantype 2)
   - cleaned up the way some internal strings are read (thanks to Peter H. Li)
  					
  2006/10/16 (v4.0b):
   - added Drag and Drop support to the ControlPanel. Simply drag and drop an lsm image from your filemanager onto the ControlPanel to open it.
   - fixed an Image5D bug, preventing the correct conversion of stacks into image5d
   - macro aware,  Syntax: run("Show LSM Toolbox","file=path_to_lsm_file") to open the file (control panel is not shown)
   - plugin aware,  Syntax: runPlugIn("LSM_Toolbox","file=path_to_lsm_file") to open the file (control panel is not shown)
   - newer versions of HandleExtraFileType (bundled in stable ImageJ 1.37) can discern if LSM_Toolbox is installed alongside LSM_Reader.
     if the toolbox is found it will used instead of the reader. an IJ.open(path_to_file) is then the preferred way to open an image.
   - corrected the image stamping. Stamping of files is possible via an image selection dialog
   - new batch processing dialog

  2006/09/07 (v4.0):
   - code refactoring part II. LSM_Reader is renamed to LSM_Toolbox. A plugin named LSM_Rader will continue to be developed but it will
     be restricted to simply adding the ability to open LSM images to ImageJ. LSM_Toolbox will be the more evolved version, with more features.
     Everything has basically been rewritten. The following features have been added:
   - compatible with LSM version 4.0 file format
   - !!!!!compressed image are opened correctly at last!!!!!
   - preview function shows first image of first image directory
   - binding to LSM_Merge or LSM_Fuse if those plugins are installed
   - choice to open a timelapse or z-stack or lambda-stack in HyperVolume_Browser OR Image5D if these plugins are installed
   - new tags are recognized (Scaninfo and others)
   - faster than the previous versions
   - improved interface
   - help function
   - details tree can be expanded or collapsed
   - access to LSM_Fusion and LSM_Merge if those plugins are installed
   - countless bugs have been squashed
  						 	
  2005/10/19 (v3.2g):
   - code refactoring PART I. Should make it more readable and flexible. 
   - Modified to read the AIM-Release 3.5 (uncompressed) files (F. Hecht, Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Advanced Imaging Microscopy Division)
 
  2005/07/21 (v3.2f):
   - adds support for time events detection. There is now a time event window that opens together with the image if it is a time series, 
     and this text is tab separated and can be saved in .txt format. YK
   - the stamps color is now fixed and is more visible. YK
   - the infos panel can now also be dumped to a text file. YK
   - fixed the Batchmode issue pointed by Wayne. JM
 
  2005/07/19 (v3.2e):
   -Works with ImageJ 1.34s  
 
  2003/12/01 (v3.2d):
   - adds compatibility with the "Handle Extra File Type " Plug-In. This plug-in must be edited with the following code :
     (just copy and paste this code into the Handle Extra File Type in the appropriate place, then recompile it.)
                        //  Zeiss Confocal LSM 510 image file (.lsm) handler
                        //  http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/
                        if (name.endsWith(".lsm")) {
                        // Open SPEimage and display it
                        IJ.runPlugIn("LSM_Reader", path);
                        // Set flag so Opener.openImage() does not display error
                        width = IMAGE_OPENED;
                        return null;
                        }
 
  2003/12/01 (v3.2c):
    - adds the "Batch Convert" method. This method allows the batch conversion of an entire directory of lsm files
 						into various usual file format : tiff, 8-bit tiff, jpeg, raw, zip. This converter handles also stacks and lambda stacks by
 						saving one image for each slice of the stack. Credits for the base batch conversion method goes for Wayne Rasband,
  						wayne@codon.nih.gov, many thanks for his kind collaboration.
 
  2003/05/16 (v3.2b):
   - bug fix release. Fixed a bug that scrambled 12 bit images. Added option to dump stamps to text
     file
 
  2003/04/22 (v3.2):
   - handles v3.0 LSM files respectively AIM v3.2 files, SCANINFO structure is read entirely
     and shown in a JTree / property viewer. Filtered view (only viewing open channels) and
     general view. Uknown tags are also shown. Linking with Lut_Panel plugin if present.
 
  2003/04/22 (v3.0):
   - SCANINFO structure present in every LSM file, contains some very interesting information.
    Dumping of that structure is now possible. Unknown tags are shown separately. Linking with
    HyperVolume_Browser plugin if present. Added support for spectral images. Complete file reading
    rehaul. As soon as Unisys's license expires, a new version with LZW-compressed TIFF support
    should be available.
 
  2003/01/23 (v2.2):
   - handles 12 bits datasets and timelapse datasets. Single image info window.
 
  2002/09/16 (v1.2):
